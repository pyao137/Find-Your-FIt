# Find-Your-Fit

Have you ever wanted to work out, but were afraid to do it alone? If so, try our web app to find your fit!

Find Your Fit was developed using react.js, sql, and other technologies for MapHacks 2021. It connects a user to others nearby who are also looking for workout buddies.

We unfortunately do not have an actual site or server running Find Your Fit. 

However, if you want to try the code, you can clone this repository and run it locally. To do so, first use "npm install" to download the necessary packages, and also make sure you have SQL installed on your computer. Then, run the SQL code from "database-sql-code" in a locally hosted sql server, and use "npm run startall" to start the webapp.
